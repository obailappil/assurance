"Present day insurance = incite fear into consumers and make them keep paying"

If you agree with the above statement, let me know. 
I am planning to work on an open source solution. 
I would like to know your thoughts, and if you are willing to work on something together. If not, that's ok. I would still love to hear from you. 

As a start, put your thoughts as Issues in this project. We will take it from there.
